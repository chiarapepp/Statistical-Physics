# Statistical Physics - SAT-Solver
University Exam of Statistical Physics UNIFI, Implementation of a SAT Solver to demonstrate a critical region, done in collaboration with Jay Senoner and Mirko Bicchierai.

This project includes a report, which explains the theoretical background, methodology, and results. You can find the report in the `Statistical_Physics_report.pdf` file in this repository.

#  Second and Third experiment: Percentege of satisfiability and Execution time

In the first case, we present the results of a SAT solver without heuristics.
